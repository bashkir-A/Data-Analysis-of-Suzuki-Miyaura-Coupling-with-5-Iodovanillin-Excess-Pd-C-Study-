# Data-Analysis-of-Suzuki-Miyaura-Coupling-with-5-Iodovanillin-Excess-Pd-C-Study-
This project analyzes the effects of using excess palladium on carbon (Pd/C) catalyst in the Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling reaction between 5-iodovanillin and 4-methylphenylboronic acid. The script performs stoichiometric calculations, cost evaluation, mechanistic interpretation, and generates 2D/3D visualizations.

Overview:
This project analyzes the effects of using excess palladium on carbon (Pd/C) catalyst in the Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling reaction between 5-iodovanillin and 4-methylphenylboronic acid. The script performs stoichiometric calculations, cost evaluation, mechanistic interpretation, and generates 2D/3D visualizations showing how catalyst loading impacts yield, selectivity, and energy landscapes.

Key Features:

Stoichiometric and yield calculations for Suzuki–Miyaura coupling

Catalyst loading and cost analysis with 10× excess Pd/C

Visualization of reaction pathways and energy surfaces (normal vs. excess catalyst)

Mechanistic interpretation supported by literature references

Recommendations for sustainable and cost-efficient catalyst usage

Purpose:
To illustrate how over-loading palladium catalysts affects both reaction efficiency and green chemistry principles, combining quantitative data analysis with mechanistic visualization.
